Description: Scrape drupal and dataverse data, generate report of metrics. For QDR people, this document is meant to be generated as a github action. This RMarkdown document utilizes drupal and dataverse data to generate a usage report. It is heavily tailored to the QDR environment, but the dataverse API interface in particular should be reusable.
